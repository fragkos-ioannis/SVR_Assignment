# Support Vector Regression (SVR) - University Assignment  

This repository contains all the code I developed for a university assignment focused on **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**. The objective was to:  

- Implement an **SVR model** with the help of skLearn library.  
- Tune its **hyperparameters** to optimize performance.  
- Train and evaluate the model on **two different datasets**.  
- Compare its performance against baseline models.  
- Analyze the results and document findings.  

## 📂 Contents  
- **`src/`**: Implementation of SVR, including training, testing, and tuning.  
- **`datasets/`**: From skLearn fetch_california_housing and TMDB movie dataset from Kaggle

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy, Pandas, skLearn**   

Feel free to explore the code and modify it for your own experiments! 🚀
